## Prerequisites

  + Anaconda 3.7+
  + Python 3.7+
  + Pip

## Installation

Fork this repository under your own control, then "clone" or download your remote copy onto your local computer.

Then navigate there from the command line (subsequent commands assume you are running them from the local repository's root directory):

```sh
cd rock-paper-scissors-exercise
```

Use Anaconda to create and activate a new virtual environment, perhaps called "my-game-env":

```sh
conda create -n my-game-env python=3.8 # (first time only)
conda activate my-game-env
```

From inside the virtual environment, install package dependencies:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> NOTE: if this command throws an error like "Could not open requirements file: [Errno 2] No such file or directory", make sure you are running it from the repository's root directory, where the requirements.txt file exists (see the initial `cd` step above)

## Setup

In in the root directory of your local repository, create a new file called ".env", and update the contents of the ".env" file to specify your desired username:

    PLAYER_NAME="Jon Snow"

> NOTE: the ".env" file is usually the place for passing configuration options and secret credentials, so as a best practice we don't upload this file to version control (which is accomplished via a corresponding entry in the [.gitignore](/.gitignore) file)

## Usage

Run the game script:

```py
python game.py
``` 

Once the game script is run, the user will enter either rock, paper, or scissors. If they do not enter one of these options, an error message will appear. Once the user enters one of the options, the program will simulate the computer's choice and determine a winner.
